To-Do List Application
I built this To-Do List Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help users efficiently manage their tasks. 
Hereâ€™s what I focused on:
Task Management: Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed, with the option to filter tasks based on their status.
Dynamic Functionality: JavaScript drives the task updates, ensuring that data is dynamically stored and updated in the browser.
Responsive Design: I created a clean and user-friendly interface with HTML and CSS, making the app easy to use across devices.
Skill Showcase: This project demonstrates my ability to develop interactive, data-driven web applications with JavaScript, emphasizing organization and task management.
Check out the app to see how it can help you stay on top of your tasks!
